## Introduction


CryptoPets is a pet store developed based on the Aleo chain, where players can anonymously adopt their favorite pets on it. Each pet has a unique identifier on the chain, which guarantees the uniqueness and scarcity of the pet. Players can feed and train their pets to enhance their abilities and values.

At the same time, players can also earn money by trading pets with other players, including selling, buying, or breeding them. This creates a fun, interactive and economic ecosystem for players. The use of Aleo chain technology can also protect the privacy of pet owners' personal information and asset information, providing players with a credible game experience.

In the future, we intend to make CryptoPet into a GameFi, combining with a number of applications such as NFT, using the characteristics of Aleo privacy chain to create a game kingdom on the Zk track and create a richer and more innovative game experience

The CryptoPet team has brought together top talents from Shanda, AMD, Intel and other Internet giants, who have been deeply engaged in the blockchain field for many years, and participated in the filecoin project in the past, accumulating rich experience and technical strength. In the future, the team will continue to conduct in-depth research and innovation in the fields of Aleo, Web3.0 and GameFi, zero knowledge track, and is committed to promoting the integration of blockchain technology and the game industry.
